        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Fares. I am in my 2nd year of BSc(Hons) Business Information Systems.</p>
        <p>
          I like programming and learinging a lot of new technologies.
          My hobbies consists of binging netflix and my current favorite show is "The Imperfects"

        <h2>Why I am taking this course</h2>
        <p>Since I am taking BIS, I learn about both programming and business.
          However, that means that I need to spend extra effort into learning more about programming that isn't in my
          courses.</p>

        <p>
          Moreover, Being a Software Engineer is a never ending learning experience.
          There are new technologies that are coming out constantly.
          And unless I keep up, I will become outdated very quickly.
          "Like many PHP programmers xD"

        <p>
          After this NanoDegree, I plan on doing more Freelancing until I can land a good internship.

          While Freelancing, I plan on taking another FWD program which is an Expert or Advanced level.
